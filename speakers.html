                <h2>Aaron Irizarry</h2>
                <h5>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h5>
                <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn’t end
                    with
                    neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations
                    that
                    enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and
                    for
                    designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to
                    succeed. <br>

                    In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design,
                    both
                    large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don’t,
                    and more
                    importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a
                    culture of
                    design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>
                <h5>ABOUT AARON</h5>
                <p>Aaron Irizarry is a Senior Product Designer for Nasdaq OMX, a lover of heavy metal, a foodie, and a
                    master of
                    BBQ arts. You can find some of his thoughts and presentations on the conversation surrounding design

                <h5>LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS</h5>
                <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written
                    narrative
                    and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this together. To do so
                    they’ve
                    developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information,
                    foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story. <br>

                    With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical
                    aspects
                    used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat
                    sheets,
                    and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>
                <h5>ABOUT ADAM</h5>
                <p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, communication,
                    creativity
                    and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of
                    experience
                    in
                    interaction and experience design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to
                    create
                    effective and easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no matter how utilitarian
                    a
                    tool
                    is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key to its success.

                <p>JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries like jQuery, AngularJS,
                    Backbone.js
                    and
                    more, but how can we be sure that our code is ready for production? This talk will share tips on how
                    writing
                    tests can be written easily and quickly and how to remove buggy code through testing.</p>

                <h5>DEATH TO WIREFRAMES: LONG LIVE RAPID PROTOTYPING</h5>
                <p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little better by
                    allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid
                    prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and
                    improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</p>
